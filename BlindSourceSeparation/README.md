# Introduction
Blind Source Separation is a type of Source Separation where we have little or no idea about the sources and mixing system and our goal is to reconstruct the original signals. There are many methods which we can employ to reconstruct the original signals using Principal Component Analysis, Dependent Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis. In this work, we implemented the Independent Component analysis which reconstruct the original signals by mixing the original signals using some mixing system and did some experiments by tweaking the hyper parameters.
