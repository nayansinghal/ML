# Introduction
Hand Digit Recognition is a well renowned problem, and people have come up with a lot of ways to solve the problem. One of the ways to solve the problem is through statistical rules, but it will be very hard because every person has different handwriting style and we can’t generalize the rules for all the users. The other way to solve the problem is through Machine Learning in which the system will automatically learn different handwriting and can identify them. But most of the time, the feature vector is highly correlated and very hard to distinguish in that coordinate axis. So, it’s beneficial if we can transform them into some other coordinate frame so that they are separable in that coordinate frame.

The process of finding the best coordinate frame is called Principal Compo- nent Analysis. PCA converts the set of vectors that is correlated and very hard to distinguish in that coordinate frame into the set of vectors that are uncor- related to each other. The number of principal components is less or equal to the number of the original vectors. The first principal component has highest variance and all other succeeding components have variance smaller than the previous ones. The other advantage of using PCA is that it helps in fast training of the model as our dataset is projected onto some lower dimensional space.
